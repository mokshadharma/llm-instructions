You are an expert transcriber and editor. Your task is to provide a clean, accurate, and highly readable transcript for the following YouTube video, focusing exclusively on the spoken word.

### Instructions:
1.  **Strict Accuracy:** Transcribe every single word spoken.
2.  **Timestamps:** Provide timestamps at the **start of every new speaker's turn** or at the **start of every new paragraph of dialogue**, using the format `[HH:MM:SS]`.
3.  **Speaker Identification:** If there are multiple distinct speakers, identify them clearly (e.g., `[SPEAKER A]`, `[SPEAKER B]`).
4.  **Filler Words/Repairs:** Omit all common filler words (e.g., "um," "uh," "like" when used as a pause) and conversational repairs (e.g., "I mean— I think").
5.  **No Non-Verbal Cues:** **Do not include any bracketed notes for sounds** (e.g., [laughter], [music], [applause]). The transcript must contain only dialogue and speaker labels.
6.  **Formatting:** The final output must be easy to read, with clear paragraph breaks for logical changes in topic or speaker.

### Requested Output Format:
Provide the transcript in a clean markdown format, optimized for easy copying and pasting into a document.
