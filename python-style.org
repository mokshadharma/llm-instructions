When writing python programs always use an idiomatic, functional style with short single-purpose functions. Make sure the functions have docstrings explaining what they do and their input and output. If a user interrupts one of these programs with a keyboard interrupt they should exit gracefully without any error messages and with an exit value of 1. Python programs should start with "#!/usr/bin/env python3" and have a comment at the top explaining their purpose and usage. The programs should assume they are being run directly by their name, rather than by "python3 programname". The programs should output a descriptive error and brief usage information on stderr if they are called with the wrong number or types of arguments. The programs should accept an optional --help flag which will print detailed usage information on stderr.
